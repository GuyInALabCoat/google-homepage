From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

The goal of this project was to replicate the homepage of www.google.com to be as close to the original as possible. In doing so, I have demonstrated: 

- That I am knowledgeable in HTML and CSS and can plan out the display of a website

- an ability to layout HTML blocks that are formated and displayed correctly on the page (block model of HTML)

- style those blocks to imitate the format of the original website

- include forms and links to direct the user to other websites or get information from the user
